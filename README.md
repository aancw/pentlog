## ✨ Why PentLog?

### The Problem with Traditional Logging

Using `script`, `tmux`, or basic shell redirection during pentests creates **fragmented, unsearchable, unmaintainable evidence**:

- 🔴 **Lost commands** — Mixed with noise, impossible to extract context
- 🔴 **No integrity** — How do you prove logs weren't tampered with?
- 🔴 **Manual reports** — Hours spent copying/pasting into documents
- 🔴 **Evidence gaps** — ANSI codes, terminal artifacts, overwrites break readability
- 🔴 **Compliance nightmares** — No audit trails, no encrypted archives

### How PentLog Solves It

- ✅ **Evidence-First Design** — Every command + output captured with perfect fidelity using Virtual Terminal Emulator (handles colors, overwrites, redraws—what you see matches what happened)
- ✅ **Context & Metadata** — Automatic timestamps, operator tracking, client/engagement organization from day one
- ✅ **Searchable Everything** — Find any command across all sessions with regex + boolean operators in seconds
- ✅ **Compliance-Ready** — Integrity hashes, AES-256 encrypted archives, detailed audit trails
- ✅ **Reports in Minutes** — Auto-generate Markdown/HTML with AI-powered summaries (no manual copy/paste)
- ✅ **No Root Required** — Works as normal user; logs land safely in `~/.pentlog/`
- ✅ **Interactive Workflows** — Intuitive TUI for engagement creation, phase switching, searching, and notes
- ✅ **Replayable** — Faithful session playback with `ttyplay` preserves exact timing
- ✅ **Integrity Protection** — `pentlog freeze` generates SHA256 hashes for evidence packaging

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install (macOS/Linux) — ~30 seconds
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aancw/pentlog/main/install.sh | sh

# 2. Setup (one-time) — Verify dependencies
pentlog setup

# 3. Create engagement — Interactive wizard
pentlog create

# 4. Start recording — Shell with ttyrec running
pentlog shell
# → You now have high-fidelity logs in ~/.pentlog/logs/
# → Logs are indexed in SQLite, ready to search

# 5. Search logs — Find commands across all sessions
pentlog search

# 6. Export report — Generate Markdown/HTML for client
pentlog export
```

**What you get after 5 minutes**:
- ✅ Searchable terminal logs with perfect fidelity (ANSI colors, overwrites, etc.)
- ✅ Timestamped commands organized by Client → Engagement → Phase
- ✅ Compliance-ready HTML reports with AI summaries
- ✅ Encrypted archives for secure client delivery

## 🛠️ Installation

### Requirements

- **Go 1.24.0+** (if building from source)
- **ttyrec** (terminal recording tool)
- **ttyplay** (optional, for session replay)

### Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aancw/pentlog/main/install.sh | sh
pentlog setup  # One-time dependency check and setup
```

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aancw/pentlog.git
cd pentlog
go build -o pentlog main.go

# Or cross-compile for Linux
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o pentlog main.go
```

### Install System Dependencies

**Automatic** (recommended):
```bash
pentlog setup  # Auto-installs on macOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, Alpine
```

**Manual Installation**:
- **macOS**: `brew install ttyrec`
- **Ubuntu/Debian/WSL**: `sudo apt-get install ttyrec`
- **Fedora**: `sudo dnf install ttyrec`
- **Alpine**: `sudo apk add ttyrec`

### ⚠️ Security Best Practices

- **Password-Protected Archives**: Use interactive mode (`pentlog archive`) instead of `--password` flag to avoid storing passwords in shell history
- **Database Permissions**: Sensitive files are created with 0600 permissions automatically
- **Evidence Integrity**: Use `pentlog freeze` before archiving for compliance audits
